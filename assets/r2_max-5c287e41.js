Considering that 2.5G has already become mainstream in the current market, the R2 Max aims to offer users a longer product lifecycle. With an eye on both cost and future-proofing, we’ve designed it with two 10GbE ports and two 2.5GbE ports. The 10GbE ports use <strong><a href="https://cn.marvell.com/">Marvell</a></strong>’s <strong>AQC113C-B1-C</strong> chip, supporting <strong>six-speed auto-negotiation</strong> for 10M/100M/1G/2.5G/5G/10G <small>(compatible with the newly released Realtek RTL8126-CG single-port 5Gbps NIC)</small>. This design fully harnesses the processor’s performance while maintaining excellent thermal management. The R2 Max is a consumer-grade, home open-source firewall and mini server product that excels in thermal performance and NIC compatibility.</p><p><strong class="block grey">1.

Cooling Design</strong></p><p class="notice">TDP (Thermal Design Power), also known as thermal design power (watts), refers to the maximum amount of heat generated under maximum theoretical load. TDP is commonly used as a key reference for designing cooling systems or reducing power consumption. A higher TDP indicates that more heat is generated per unit of time during operation. For a cooling system, TDP serves as the minimum standard for cooling capacity, meaning the system must be able to dissipate at least the amount of heat indicated by the TDP value.<br>— From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power">Wikipedia</a>.</p>',38)),i(c,null,{default:n((()=>p[0]||(p[0]=[a("⚠ TDP is not a measure of power consumption; it is a reference for cooling design. ⚠")]))),_:1,__:[0]}),p[2]||(p[2]=r('<hr><p>We are committed to solving cooling challenges, even if it means <strong>doubling costs</strong>, to ensure 100% performance from the processor.

FAQs</strong></p><p>Q: <strong>Cannot power on the device, No HDMI signal, Cannot enter to BIOS menu, etc.</strong></p><p class="notice">A: When booting up the R2 Max for the first time—especially if you’ve installed your own memory and storage—please ensure that the memory is firmly seated. If you’re using memory modules not listed on our compatibility tests at <a href="http://wiki.ikoolcore.com">wiki.ikoolcore.com</a>, we cannot guarantee compatibility. However, you can share your memory model with us, and we’ll work on optimizing BIOS compatibility in future updates.<br>If you’re having trouble getting the device to power on and enter the BIOS on the first boot, follow these troubleshooting steps: <br>1.<strong>Check memory compatibility</strong> and make sure the memory module is securely installed.<br>2.After inserting or reseating the memory and other hardware, the device may take longer to start up as it runs a self-check process. Please be patient.<br>3.On the first boot with the memory properly installed, the device’s fan will run at full speed. Before the self-check begins, you’ll hear a single “beep” sound. The self-check usually takes 10-20 seconds, but it may take longer depending on the memory used. Once complete, the device will power off briefly (the power LED will turn off, and the fan will stop). It will then restart automatically and beep again. Around 5-8 seconds later, you should enter the BIOS.<br>4. If the device completes the above steps but still doesn’t output any display to your monitor, check the monitor and cables. Try swapping both the monitor and the cable to see if the issue persists. Alternatively, you can use the USB-C port to connect to a monitor that supports video output via USB-C port.<br><strong>These startup issues are common for first-time users of the R2 Max</strong>.</p><p>Q: Can the system be pre-installed?</p><p class="notice">A: We do not offer system pre-installation service for any orders. For each user has their own unique setup plans and preferences.</p><p>Q: How long is the warranty period?</p><p class="notice">A: All orders come with a one-year warranty starting from the date of receipt. After the one-year period, we also offer repair support.
